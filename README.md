### About the Experiment 

Optical fibers are fine transparent glass or plastic fibers that propagate light using the phenomenon of total internal reflection from diametrically opposite walls. In this way, light can be transmitted over long distances with minimal loss, and the flexibility of fibers allows light to be routed around curves and obstacles. This makes optical fibers ideal for communication systems, medical instruments, and sensing applications. The numerical aperture (NA) of an optical fiber is a critical parameter that defines its light-gathering ability.
