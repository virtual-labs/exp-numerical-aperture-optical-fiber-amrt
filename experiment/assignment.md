## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    Using the given apparatus, find the numerical aperture and acceptance angle of a glass-glass fiber.
  </li>

  <li>
    A detector is placed at a distance 2 mm from a laser source emitting red light. Find the numerical aperture of the plastic-glass fiber used.
  </li>

  <li>
    For different laser sources, find the variation in numerical aperture and acceptance angle of a glass-glass fiber with detector distance when the distance between the source and detector is 3 mm.
  </li>

  <li>
    A plastic-glass fiber is used to transmit blue light. Obtain the angle of incidence at which the light can be propagated through the fiber without any loss.
  </li>

  <li>
    Compare the acceptance angle for a glass-glass fiber and a plastic-glass fiber for propagating green light without loss.
  </li>
